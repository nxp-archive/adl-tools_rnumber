RNumber
=======

RNumber is an arbitrary-length integer class.  While the main
implementation is in C++, bindings exist for C, Perl, and Bigloo.
What differentiates RNumber from many other examples of
arbitrary-sized integers is that a given number object has a fixed
size.  In other words, it is a bit vector with arithmetic operations.
This makes it suitable for modeling hardware resources such as
registers.  However, the size may be modified during run-time, making
it more flexible than some other implementations, such as SystemC.


Platforms:
----------

Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

	A solution file (rnumber.sln) and project file (rnumber.vcproj) are provided.


MinGW32

	Basic support for MinGW is provided, but the regression framework
	has not been fully ported.  Simply run "./configure" and "make all check
	install" to build and install the package.

Cygwin

	RNumber works on Cygwin.  Just run "./configure" and "make all check
	install" to build, run the regression, and install the package.

Linux (32 and 64 bit)

	This is the primary development platform for RNumber.  Just run
	"./configure" and "make all check install" to build, run the
	regression, and install the package.
