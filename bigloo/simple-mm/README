Simple example of bigloo garbage collecting a c data structure.

The data structure is a C++ class that contains an integer.  The class
is private to simple.C. A 'C' interface to the class is given in
simple.h

simple_proxy.h and simple_proxy.c are supposed to be the interface
between the c world and the bigloo world. It is assumed that only
bigloo will own and control the lifetime of the c objects.

b-simple.scm is a simple test program. It should allocate and
destroy a simple object.
