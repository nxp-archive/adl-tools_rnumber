	*  perl: changed numericp to include both SvIOK and SvNOK.

        ============== rnumber release 1.11.1 (v1_11_1) on SunOS ==============

2002-12-05  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  perl: There is a problem with large integers (msb being set) not 
	   being considered to be integers by perl's SvIOK function. This is
	   what integerp uses to detect whether a variable is an integer or
	   not. I have resolved this by adding a new predicate numericp and
	   using that to determine whether a variable is numeric or not.

        ============== rnumber release 1.10.4 (v1_10_4) on SunOS ==============

        ============== rnumber release 1.10.3 (v1_10_3) on SunOS ==============

2002-11-04  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  moved directories around so that 

	         make distclean
	         ./autogen.sh 
	         make check

	   will work for those that can't be troubled with 
	
	         make distclean
	         ./autogen.sh 
		 make && make check

        ==================== rnumber release 1.8.4 (v1_8_4) ====================

2002-11-04  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  now correctly runs bigloo regression if bigloo support is compiled in.

        ==================== rnumber release 1.8.3 (v1_8_3) ====================


        ==================== rnumber release 1.8.3 (v1_8_3) ====================

2002-11-01  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Moved includes in Trace.C outside of ifdef so that an optimized
	build would work.

2002-11-01 Brian changed the version but didn't leave a note. I think all that
	was changed was the version number in configure.in
	
2002-10-31  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  added missing RNumber features to C++ version.

2002-10-30  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Made the compilation of Bigloo bindings optional.  However, the
	regression test doesn't yet work correctly- it doesn't run the Bigloo
	tests.  I'll let Todd handle that. :)

	================== release-1-8-1 ======================================
	
2002-10-29  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  moved C++ RNumber  and Random into rnumber namespace.

	================== version 1.7.1 ======================================
	
2002-10-18  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  added (rnumber->int rnumber) to convert small rnumbers to integers.

2002-10-17  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  added rnumber to the SUBDIRS of bigloo/Makefile.am

	================== version 1.7.0 ======================================
	
2002-10-09  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* exposed rn* to bigloo.
	* rnumber_ui_multiply_rn was misnamed as rnumber_ui_multiply_ui. This was fixed.

2002-09-30  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* removed print from rnumber_finalize.
	* cleaned up makefiles a bit.
	* added def for bgl_rnumber_proxy_t? so rnumber will build without unsafe
	  option.

	================== version 1.6.2 ======================================

2002-09-24  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* rnumber.scm: return #t or #f instead of 0 and non-zero.

	* rnumber.scm: added support for comparison operators so they will handle two
		integers as well as a mix of integers and rnumbers.

2002-09-04  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  rnumber.scm: added rn<< rn>> rn- rn+ rn-bitand rn-bitor

	*  changed default minimum size of RNumbers constructed from strings to 
	   be 32 bits. Previously only enough bits to hold the original value was
	   used as the minimum.

2002-09-03  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* removed number-test.scm test.

	* bigloo/rnumber.scm: added following functions
	(rn<< a b)	  (rn>> a b)	  (rn- a b)	  (rn+ a b)
