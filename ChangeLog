        ============= rnumber release 1.18.1 (v1_18_1) on SunOS =============
2003-08-05  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* minor changes to build in SUE environment.

2003-08-01  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  changes for bigloo 2.6a and swig. bigloo 2.6a is
	   now required for scheme bindings.

2003-04-21  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  Made some radix and prefix related changes.

2003-07-14  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Added a new method, RNumber::uint64(), which allows the user to
	get a 64-bit number directly and efficiently from an RNumber.

        ============= rnumber release 1.17.12 (v1_17_12) on SunOS =============

        ============= rnumber release 1.17.12 (v1_17_12) on Linux =============

        ============== rnumber release 1.17.9 (v1_17_9) on SunOS ==============

2003-05-19  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* bigloo/tests/driver.scm: fixed bug in argument parsing.

2003-04-21  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  Made some radix and prefix related changes.

2003-05-13  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Moved the basic types to a new namespace, rnumber_t, so as not
	to cause namespace pollution.

        ============== rnumber release 1.16.9 (v1_16_9) on SunOS ==============

2003-03-30  Todd Dukes  <tdukes@austin.rr.com>

	*  Fixed GCC_VERSION macro
	*  added commented out perl include path for Redhat 8.0 (swig still doesn't
	   work for this version of Perl, on Redhat 8.0 you have to build with
	   --disable-perl-bindings

2003-03-24  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Modified headers so that they should compile w/o the
	backward-compatibility warning under gcc 3.2.2.

2003-03-18  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* The tests of the C bindings have been moved to rnumber/tests so
	that they'll be run even if Bigloo or Perl bindings are not being
	created.

	* Modified RNumber::getSizeWithRadix() so that it will never return
	a size of 0 (which can cause other problems).  Instead, it will return
	a size of _defaultSize;

2003-03-17  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* I removed strradix and moved that functionality into str().  The
	format parameter stored bit flags which represents both the radix
	and other stuff, such as whether to print a prefix or not.

2003-03-07  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* rnumber is now compatible with gcc 3.2.2.

        ============== rnumber release 1.16.7 (v1_16_7) on SunOS ==============

2003-02-05  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Moved the Merseinne Twist class into rnumber, from rutil.

2003-01-29  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Ported rnumber to the newest automake/autoconf.

	* New option:  --enable-static allows for building a non-position-indepedent
	module.  On Solaris, --enable-profile implies --enable-static.

2003-01-23  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Re-did how profiling is setup so that on Linux, we build with
	position-independent code.

        ============== rnumber release 1.13.7 (v1_13_7) on SunOS ==============

2003-01-21  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* added documentation for bigloo bindings.

2003-01-06  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>
	
	* removed dist-hook to remove rvparser.yy from ./Makefile.am this
          file was never part of rnumber.
	* changes so that 'make dist' makes a buildable distribution.

        ============== rnumber release 1.13.5 (v1_13_5) on SunOS ==============

        ============== rnumber release 1.13.4 (v1_13_4) on SunOS ==============

2003-01-06  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  made documentation installation optional. Small modifications to
	   documentation.

        ============== rnumber release 1.12.1 (v1_12_1) on SunOS ==============

        ============== rnumber release 1.12.1 (v1_12_1) on SunOS ==============

2002-12-13  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  CDCpp33115 - fixed core dump on left and right shifts of integers
	   where the shift is an rnumber bigger than word size.

	* add perl operator overloading. There is some problem with shifting
	  integers by rnumbers that needs to be worked out.

2002-12-12  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* perl added memory reclamation.
	

        ============== rnumber release 1.11.3 (v1_11_3) on SunOS ==============

        ============== rnumber release 1.11.3 (v1_11_3) on Linux ==============

        ============== rnumber release 1.11.3 (v1_11_3) on SunOS ==============

2002-12-09  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Got conditional install (cinstall) working.

        ============== rnumber release 1.11.2 (v1_11_2) on SunOS ==============

2002-12-05  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  perl: changed numericp to include both SvIOK and SvNOK.

        ============== rnumber release 1.11.1 (v1_11_1) on SunOS ==============

2002-12-05  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  perl: There is a problem with large integers (msb being set) not 
	   being considered to be integers by perl's SvIOK function. This is
	   what integerp uses to detect whether a variable is an integer or
	   not. I have resolved this by adding a new predicate numericp and
	   using that to determine whether a variable is numeric or not.

        ============== rnumber release 1.10.4 (v1_10_4) on SunOS ==============

        ============== rnumber release 1.10.3 (v1_10_3) on SunOS ==============

2002-11-22  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

        ============== rnumber release 1.10.2 (v1_10_2) on SunOS ==============

2002-11-22  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

2002-11-04  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  moved directories around so that 

	         make distclean
	         ./autogen.sh 
	         make check

	   will work for those that can't be troubled with 
	
	         make distclean
	         ./autogen.sh 
		 make && make check

        ==================== rnumber release 1.8.4 (v1_8_4) ====================

2002-11-04  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  now correctly runs bigloo regression if bigloo support is compiled in.

        ==================== rnumber release 1.8.3 (v1_8_3) ====================


        ==================== rnumber release 1.8.3 (v1_8_3) ====================

2002-11-01  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Moved includes in Trace.C outside of ifdef so that an optimized
	build would work.

2002-11-01 Brian changed the version but didn't leave a note. I think all that
	was changed was the version number in configure.in
	
2002-10-31  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  added missing RNumber features to C++ version.

2002-10-30  Brian Kahne  <bkahne@ibmoto.com>

	* Made the compilation of Bigloo bindings optional.  However, the
	regression test doesn't yet work correctly- it doesn't run the Bigloo
	tests.  I'll let Todd handle that. :)

	================== release-1-8-1 ======================================
	
2002-10-29  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  moved C++ RNumber  and Random into rnumber namespace.

	================== version 1.7.1 ======================================
	
2002-10-18  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  added (rnumber->int rnumber) to convert small rnumbers to integers.

2002-10-17  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  added rnumber to the SUBDIRS of bigloo/Makefile.am

	================== version 1.7.0 ======================================
	
2002-10-09  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* exposed rn* to bigloo.
	* rnumber_ui_multiply_rn was misnamed as rnumber_ui_multiply_ui. This was fixed.

2002-09-30  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* removed print from rnumber_finalize.
	* cleaned up makefiles a bit.
	* added def for bgl_rnumber_proxy_t? so rnumber will build without unsafe
	  option.

	================== version 1.6.2 ======================================

2002-09-24  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* rnumber.scm: return #t or #f instead of 0 and non-zero.

	* rnumber.scm: added support for comparison operators so they will handle two
		integers as well as a mix of integers and rnumbers.

2002-09-04  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	*  rnumber.scm: added rn<< rn>> rn- rn+ rn-bitand rn-bitor

	*  changed default minimum size of RNumbers constructed from strings to 
	   be 32 bits. Previously only enough bits to hold the original value was
	   used as the minimum.

2002-09-03  Todd Dukes  <Todd.Dukes@motorola.com>

	* removed number-test.scm test.

	* bigloo/rnumber.scm: added following functions
	(rn<< a b)	  (rn>> a b)	  (rn- a b)	  (rn+ a b)
