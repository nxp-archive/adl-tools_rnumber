	* removed print from rnumber_finalize.
	* cleaned up makefiles a bit.

	* rnumber.scm: return #t or #f instead of 0 and non-zero.

	* rnumber.scm: added support for comparison operators so they will handle two
		integers as well as a mix of integers and rnumbers.

	*  rnumber.scm: added rn<< rn>> rn- rn+ rn-bitand rn-bitor

	* removed number-test.scm test.

	* bigloo/rnumber.scm: added following functions
